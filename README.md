# Article read time module - Drupal 8
***
Module provides the time it will take and individual to read an article or a blog post.
---

Calculation is fairly simple: <br>
Since average words per minute = 225wmp<br>
article read time for words = 225/number of words in the post/article<br>
article read time for an image = number of images * 12<br>
overall artical read time = article read time for words + article read time for an image
